## Office of the Webminister

## Kingdom Webminister
The Kingdom Webminister is responsible for maintaining the Kingdom web site, determining web
policy for the kingdom, and working with Local Webministers to insure pages are accurate and
appropriate for the SCA. The Kingdom Webminister is charged with ensuring that the information
is updated in a timely manner (to be defined as no greater than 72 hours from content receipt)
The Kingdom Webminister is ultimately responsible for all web content which pertains to the
Kingdom of the Outlands, and is charged with coordinating with all Kingdom entities which may
have their own websites to ensure all web content is presented in a manner which meet
certification standards described in this document. The Kingdom Webminister is required to
provide server space for all Kingdom groups and entities which request it. It is the duty of the
Kingdom Webminister to maintain contact information for the Kingdom web hosting company. It
is the duty of the Kingdom Webminister to maintain a list of all usernames and passwords for
accounts on the Kingdom web server to aid in future office transitions. For any web-based
application developed for the Kingdom site, it is the duty of the Kingdom Webminister to ensure
there is enough in-line documentation to ensure future Webministers are able to maintain the
code. The Kingdom Webminister reports to the Kingdom Chronicler and the Society Webminister.

### Deputy Webministers
The Kingdom Webminister may designate deputies as needed to help maintain a clean and
accurate web presence for the Kingdom.

### Group Webminister
The designated Webminister for a local group, and in the event that a group has several web sites, the Seneschal of the group will determine what web site is the official one for their group. It is recommended, in order to save money, to request and use space on the Kingdom server.

## Structure of the Outlands Web Presence
### Kingdom Web Content
The Kingdom Webminister (or an appointed deputy) is responsible for maintaining the following mandatory information on the Kingdom web site or see that this information is part of an officer's web site:
* An accurate electronic version of the Kingdom Calendar.
* A complete and up-to-date list of Greater Officers.
* Contact information for all Royalty and Landed Nobility.
* Up-to-date versions of Outlands Kingdom Law, Heavy Weapons Combat Rules, Rapier Combat Rules and the Outlandish Chroniclers Handbook and publishing policies for the Outlandish Herald..
* Any other official documents as mandated by the Kingdom Seneschal.
* A complete and up-to-date list of all groups within the Kingdom and contact information for their Seneschallate.
* When possible, no personal e-mail addresses will be listed, and any role based e-mail addresses will be listed in the format role ‘at’ group.org without a hyperlink, or with an obscured hyperlink.
* When the structure is in place, phone numbers, mailing addresses, personal e-mail addresses and correlation between real name and SCA name may be provided behind a secure login page.
* All information which changes on a regular basis should be stored in a database, and be dynamically bound to the page it is to be displayed upon.

Outside of those mandated items above, the Kingdom Webminister reserves the right as to what is listed or not listed on the Outlands web site.

### Officer Pages
All official websites for Kingdom Officers will reside on the Kingdom Server and be hosted
through the official Kingdom of the Outlands Website. Any Kingdom Officer website residing
outside of the main Kingdom of the Outlands server is considered “unofficial” and cannot contain
official kingdom or society information. This will ensure the consistency of websites and the
ability of the Kingdom Webminister to ensure a smooth transition from officer to officer. If the
Kingdom Officer has sufficient technical expertise and ability, they can maintain their own officer
pages once the appropriate security and log into the Kingdom Website has been arranged by the
Kingdom Webminister.

meet the certification standards put forth in this document. Local Seneschals will designate which
page is their group’s officially recognized page.

## Editorial Content
Editorial comments and articles should be clearly marked as such. Webministers should take
great care in making sure that the content of the Editorial material is not libelous and is in keeping
with the spirit of the SCA and its goals.

## Financial Activities
Because the cost of domains and web hosting can be high, it is recommended that caution be
exercised before using SCA funds to support your web site. The Kingdom will provide web-
hosting space for free to groups which can not maintain their own website and for a minimal
charge for groups which do maintain their own website. It is highly recommended that all groups
take advantage of this service, as it will save the Kingdom money, and provide a greater service
to its populace.

No matter how the site is funded, all pages must meet the financial requirements listed here.
Advertising is strictly forbidden, this includes banner ads from such sites as Geocities. Geocities
and the like are strictly prohibited from being used as hosting services. If your web pages are paid
for with SCA funds, you must turn in financial reports and expense reports to your local
Exchequer, and the Kingdom Webminister. The form of this reporting is left up to the discretion of
the Exchequer. If you use SCA funds to purchase software or equipment, this property belongs to
the SCA. Copies of SCA purchased software may not be kept for personal use after the
Webminister steps down.

## Links
All links maintained on official websites must be tested at least quarterly to ensure that they are
still correct. Broken links must be updated or deleted upon discovery of the break.

mail) of the person identified. This information includes, but is not limited to; Modern name, home
or work address, phone number or e-mail addresses. Photos and artwork that depict specific
individuals must be used with care. The person or persons in the representation have the right to
request that their image be removed from your site at any time. When at all possible, this
information should be secured behind a login / password. Please see the Kingdom Webminister
for assistance in achieving this level of security.

### Credit and Permission
Other people’s graphics, prose or poetry, articles, photos or other artwork should be used only
with specific permission to do so. If required by the originator these items should also include
copyright and credit to the author. If you have copyright issues that you cannot find an answer to
yourself, please try the U.S. Copyright office. Their URL is http://lcweb.loc.gov/copyright/ , You
